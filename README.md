# egg.sh
### A new way to style gui in roblox?

## Why?
egg.sh plans to fix a simple yet overlooked aspect in roblox; styling isn't any fun. You may make a gui that looks good but it probably required digging through properties to do. Egg.sh fixes all that. With CSS-like syntax, you can style with true ease in roblox.

## Getting Started
To get started, simply download the `.rbxm` in the build folder. You can also copy and paste the code from `./src/eggshell/Main.lua` into a module script file. Documentation is planned.
